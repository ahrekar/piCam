# piCam

piCam is a collection of bash scripts that are used to operate webcams using a raspberry pi.

There are two aspects to this project: 1. Timelapse photos and 2. Motion detecting camera.

# Timelapse photos
This function involves collecting timelapse photos and concatenate them into a stop-motion film. 

# Motion detecting camera
This function was intended to count the number of instances of motion in a very small region. I wanted to count the number of bubbles that went through an airlock in my brewing setup. I also hope to use it to capture images of lightning in the future.
